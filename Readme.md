**Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive and educational tool designed to make learning algorithms fun and intuitive. It provides visual representations of sorting techniques, backtracking problems, and tree structures, making it easier to understand the concepts step-by-step.

## **Features**  

### **1. Sorting Algorithms**  
Visualize five fundamental sorting algorithms:  
- **Bubble Sort**  
- **Selection Sort**  
- **Insertion Sort**  
- **Quick Sort**  
- **Merge Sort**  

Each sorting visualization includes:  
- **Step-by-step animations** for understanding algorithm behavior.  
- **Controls**: Start, Pause, Reset, Adjust Speed, and Array Size Selector (3 to 10 elements).  
- **Additional resources**: Video explanations and articles for theoretical understanding.  

> *Note: Sorting visualization is limited to arrays of size 10 due to screen-width constraints, and inputs are currently randomized.*

### **2. Backtracking Problems**  
Delve into classic backtracking algorithms:  
- **Rat in a Maze**: Find a path for a rat from `(0,0)` to `(n-1, n-1)` while avoiding obstacles.  
  - Customizable grid size (up to 9x9).  
  - Add obstacles interactively.  
  - Controls: Start, Pause, Reset.  

- **N-Queens Problem**: Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.  
  - Customizable grid size (up to 9x9).  
  - Clear visualization of backtracking steps.  

Both algorithms come with video explanations and articles for deeper understanding.

### **3. Tree Structures**  
Learn about two essential tree data structures:  
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:  
  - Insert and delete nodes interactively.  
  - View in-order traversal (sorted order of elements).  

- **AVL Tree**:  
  - Self-balancing binary search tree with rotations.  
  - Visualize insertions, deletions, and balancing steps.  
  - Pause/Resume feature to understand rotations clearly.  

Both tree visualizations include video explanations and articles.
